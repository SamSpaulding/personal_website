I am a Ph.D. student in the  [Personal Robots Group](robotic.media.mit.edu) at the [MIT Media Lab](media.mit.edu), advised by Professor [Cynthia Breazeal](http://web.media.mit.edu/~cynthiab). My research broadly focuses on designing, programming, and evaluating robotic systems to create engaging and natural Human-Robot Interaction.

My work aims to advance AI and Robotics by building intelligent systems that can successfully interact with others to achieve goals in the real world. In addition to other robots and intelligent agents, real world robots are increasingly interacting closely and in-person with humans, so an important component of my research focuses on building robots that can interact flexibly and fluently with humans, with particular emphases on designing social robots that can construct models of other agents throughout an interaction, take actions based on these models, and reason about and refine its actions and the models of the interaction partner(s). I believe that AI and Robotics are transformative technologies and have a special passion for finding creative and impactful applications for these fields (especially in Education and Art)
		
Before coming to MIT, I received a B.S. in Computer Science from Yale University. While there, I worked with Professor Brian Scassellati in the [Yale Social Robotics Lab](http://scazlab.yale.edu). and spent summers working at [Amazon.com](http://https://www.amazon.jobs/en/job_categories/software-development) and at [Disney Research](http://https://www.amazon.jobs/en/job_categories/software-development) with Senior Research Scientist Jonathan Yedidia.
