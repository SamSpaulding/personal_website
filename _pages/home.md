I am currently a Robot Skills Engineer at [Jibo, Inc.](www.jibo.com) on leave from my graduate studies with the  [Personal Robots Group](robotic.media.mit.edu) at the [MIT Media Lab](media.mit.edu), advised by Professor [Cynthia Breazeal](http://web.media.mit.edu/~cynthiab). My research broadly focuses on designing and programming robotic systems to create engaging and natural Human-Robot Interaction.
		
My work aims to advance A.I. and robotics through building intelligent systems that operate in the real world with all its complexity. In the wild, robots will have to interact closely with humans, so an important component of my research focuses on building robots that can interact naturally and comfortably with humans, one aim of the field of [Social Robotics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_robot). I am particularly interested in applying these skills to the domains of Education and Entertainment, and work in the sub-field of [Socially Assistive Robots](http://robotshelpingkids.yale.edu) to further these goals.
		
Before coming to MIT, I received a B.S. in Computer Science from Yale University. While there, I worked with Professor Brian Scassellati in the [Yale Social Robotics Lab](http://scazlab.yale.edu). and spent summers working at [Amazon.com](http://https://www.amazon.jobs/en/job_categories/software-development) and at [Disney Research](http://https://www.amazon.jobs/en/job_categories/software-development)  with Senior Research Scientist Jonathan Yedidia.
