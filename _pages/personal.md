Outside of school and work, I'm a big fan of trivia, in which category I include wordplay, coincidences, facts, historical stories, and other interesting or amusing pieces of information.

I previously played on MIT and Yale's Quiz Bowl teams in a competitive intercollegiate academic quiz league, and I was briefly known for my ability to [answer questions](images/trebek.jpg) for money [on TV](images/millionaire.jpg). 

I love to read, both fiction and non-fiction. Some of my favorite authors are Tom Robbins and Douglas Hofstadter, and I especially enjoy historical biographies.

I also like to do things outside including, but not limited to: hiking, running, camping, climbing, exploring interesting spaces, or just sitting around enjoying nice weather.

I built this site based partly on the excellent template provided by the <a href="http://www.allanlab.org/aboutwebsite.html">Allen Lab</a> at Leiden University.
