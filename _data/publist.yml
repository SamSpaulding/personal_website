- title: Creating better superconductors by periodic nanopatterning

  description:
    We  propose  an approach to transform a ‘pristine’ material into a better (meta-) superconductor by making use of modern fabrication techniques -- designing and engineering the electronic properties of thin films via periodic patterning on the nanoscale.

- title: Poor electronic screening in lightly doped Mott insulators observed with scanning tunneling microscopy

  description:
    We develop a simple model to interpret STM results on lightly doped Mott insulators, and find that the effective Mott gap measured by STM correspons to the one measured with other techniques when taking into account the poor electronic screeing.

- title: Universality of pseudo gap and emergent order in lightly doped Mott insulators
  image: Pub_M2PG.png
  description:
    We discover of electronic order, pseudo gap phase separation and an impurity-band Mott transition in an iridate compound, cuprate-style. Along the way, we gained unique knowledge on how a Mott state collapses.
